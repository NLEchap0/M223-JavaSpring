#🎯 Module Competence
The primary objective of this module is to develop multi-user object-oriented applications, including database adjustments, implementation, testing, and comprehensive documentation.

#🧠 Key Learning Objectives
Database Concurrency: Ensuring databases meet multi-user capacity requirements.

Transaction Management: Implementing transactions to guarantee data integrity in a multi-user environment.

Persistence Layers: Bridging the gap between the Business Object Model and Relational Data Models (ORM).

Architecture: Exploring Client/Server, Multitier, Middleware, and Framework architectures.

Security & Rights: Implementing user authorization and multi-user rights management.

Quality Assurance: Defining and executing functional and non-functional tests for multi-user scenarios.

#🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Java 21+

Framework: Spring Boot (Data JPA, Web, Security)

Database: SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL/H2)

Modeling: UML (Class & Sequence Diagrams)

Tools: Maven/Gradle, JUnit, Mockito

#📂 Repository Structure
📂 Theory/: Conceptual notes on DBMS multi-user capacity and ACID transactions.

📂 Exercises/: Small-scale Java Spring implementations focusing on specific module goals.

📂 Projects/: Full-scale multi-user applications with integrated database layers and user interfaces.

📂 Docs/: Testing protocols, UML diagrams, and transaction documentation.

#📝 Performance Goals
Analyze if a database satisfies multi-user requirements.

Develop applications utilizing transactions for data consistency.

Implement user interfaces and permission profiles.

Test functional and non-functional aspects of multi-user capacity.

Document transactions for maintainability and reproducibility.
